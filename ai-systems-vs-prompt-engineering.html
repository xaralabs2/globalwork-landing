<h1>AI Systems vs Prompt Engineering</h1>

<p>
Prompt engineering focuses on inputs. AI systems engineering focuses on control,
reliability, and accountability.
</p>

<h2>Why Prompt Engineering Breaks in Production</h2>
<p>
Prompts do not provide governance, audit trails, escalation logic, or cost control.
</p>

<h2>What AI Systems Engineering Includes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Multi-step workflows</li>
  <li>Human-in-the-loop oversight</li>
  <li>Agent permissions</li>
  <li>Logging and auditability</li>
</ul>

<h2>Career Impact</h2>
<p>
Prompt roles are fragile. AI systems roles are long-term, trusted, and scarce.
