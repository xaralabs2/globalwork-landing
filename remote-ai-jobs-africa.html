<h1>How to Get a Remote AI Job from Africa</h1>

<p>
Remote AI jobs are growing fast, but most candidates fail because they are trained
for tools instead of systems.
</p>

<h2>What Global Employers Actually Want</h2>
<ul>
  <li>System thinking</li>
  <li>Production experience</li>
  <li>Ability to supervise automation</li>
  <li>Clear communication across time zones</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Africa Has an Advantage</h2>
<p>
African engineers are adaptive, resilient, and experienced with constraints.
What is missing is operator-level AI systems training.
</p>

<h2>What You Must Be Able to Show</h2>
<p>
Not certificates — but systems: workflows, APIs, monitoring, logs, and escalation paths.
